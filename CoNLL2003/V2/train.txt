more 0

potential 0

in 0
Germany 4

that 0

If 0
that 0
were 0
the 0
case 0

it 0
was 0

why 0

it 0
would 0

campaign 0
. 0
Obviously 0
we 0
are 0
interested 0

We 0
will 0
ask 0

We 0
agreed 0
that 0

which 0
would 0
take 0
out 0
the 0
maximum 0
number 0
of 0

possible 0
. 0
I 0
think 0
it 0
would 0
be 0
very 0
difficult 0
to 0
sell 0
to 0
the 0
European 1
Commission 1
a 0
programme 0
which 0
would 0
involve 0
the 0
elimination 0
of 0

Kiely 3

. 0
We 0
will 0
look 0
at 0
our 0
approach 0
( 0
to 0

we 0
wo 0
n't 0
get 0
involved 0
with 0
the 0
number 0
of 0

to 0
be 0
slaughtered 0
, 0
he 0
said 0
. 0
We 0
have 0
always 0
avoided 0
the 0
question 0
of 0
numbers 0
of 0
animals 0
to 0
be 0
slaughtered 0
, 0
that 0
's 0
not 0
the 0

The 0
issue 0
is 0
the 0
protection 0
of 0
consumers 0
' 0
health 0
and 0
the 0
rapid 0
eradication 0
of 0
BSE 2
, 0
he 0
added 0
. 0
The 0
reaction 0
is 0
likely 0
to 0
disappoint 0
British 2

who 0
seized 0
on 0
research 0
by 0

new 0

to 0

means 0
some 0
of 0
that 0

I 0

our 0

judgment 0
at 0

that 0
it 0

probably 0

along 0

the 0

way 0
it 0

the 0

to 0
9.5 0

11.3 0

I 0
think 0
the 0
figure 0
of 0
9.5 0
percent 0
on 0
the 0
first 0
half 0
, 0
when 0
you 0
consider 0
the 0

that 0
we 0

been 0
destocking 0

the 0
fairly 0

the 0

that 0
